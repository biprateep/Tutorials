# Tutorials
Tutorials (mostly python) I made for teaching. The required datasets used in the tutorial can be found in `/data` folder.
### Here's the list of available tutorials:
- **Numpy Basics :** A series of four notebooks to  teach numpy to astronomers. They were originally developed for the AstroPGH python bootcamps (2020, 2021, 2022, ...). Each notebook is designed for an hour long guided hands on tutorial session.
- (Work in progress) **How to Train Your Perceptron :** A series of `n` notebooks with opinionated best practices for training neural networks.
- (Work in Progress) **Python Parallelization for Lazy People:** A series of `n` notebooks with quick recipes for parallelizing python code without much thought.
